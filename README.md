## Barcode Scanner Module

### Overview
This repository is dedicated to providing a versatile and easy-to-use barcode scanner module for various platforms, including Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Raspberry Pico boards. The code is designed for the [Barcode Scanner Module](https://www.waveshare.com/barcode-scanner-module.htm), a small 1D/2D codes reader that uses intelligent image recognition algorithms to decode barcodes or 2D codes on paper or screen, fast and accurately. It can be directly plugged into a computer or easily integrated into various devices due to its small form factor[1].

### Features
